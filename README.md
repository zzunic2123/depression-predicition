In this study, the possibility of classifying affective disorders using fractal dimensions as features of EEG signals was explored. The database used was created at the Vrapƒçe Psychiatric Clinic, which includes data on patients with diagnoses F32 (depression) and F33 (recurrent depressive disorder). After preprocessing the signals, which involved filtering the signals in the frequency range from 0,1 Hz to 40 Hz and applying Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to identify artifacts, the signals were divided into five frequency ranges, each representing a brain wave. For each of the 19 channels, four different fractal dimensions were calculated - Higuchi's, Sevcik's, Katz's, and Petrosian's. These fractal dimensions served as features for further analysis. After adding diagnostic information, the final datasets for training and testing were obtained. The training set includes 50 ill examinees and 25 healthy ones, while the testing set includes 20 ill and 10 healthy examinees. The results of this study show that it is possible to use fractal dimensions as features of EEG signals for the classification of affective disorders.
